<!-- 
Create a small HTML file that includes:
A main heading with your name.
A subheading with a title like "About Me".
A paragraph describing who you are, what you do, or what you're learning.
Use bold to highlight something important (e.g., your skills).
Use italic for something like a hobby or interest.
Use a line break to split sentences within a paragraph (without starting a new one).
Use a horizontal rule to separate sections (e.g., between "About Me" and "Hobbies"). -->
